        "A parameter is a configuration variable internal to a machine learning model, estimated from data during training. Examples include weights in linear regression or decision thresholds in trees. Parameters help the model make predictions and are optimized to minimize error.\n",

        "**2. What is correlation?**\n",
        "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, showing how one changes with respect to the other. It ranges from -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive). A correlation of 0 implies no linear relationship between the variables.\n",

        "**3. What does negative correlation mean?**\n",
        "Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. For example, if study time increases and the number of errors decreases, they are negatively correlated. It indicates an inverse relationship between the two variables.\n",
